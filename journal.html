Journal Entry #1: 9/29/25
I made my photo card of Lightning Mcqueen today. My website is progressing well! So far my home page which is a road is good but I want to incorporate car pictures into it somehow but I think I need to book a lab. I still need to do my projects page but my journal page is looking good!

Journal Entry #2: 10/16/25
Today I added a second car so that both animations are running smoothly on my index page. I also need to find a way to flip the top car so it goes to the right forwards instead of backwards.

Journal Entry #2: 10/23/25
Today I made the top car run forward instead of backwards and I removed the two blue dashes. I hope to get to work on my projects page next.
